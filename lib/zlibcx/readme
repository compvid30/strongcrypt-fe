zlibw114 is my (WE) Pascal port of the zlib library V1.1.4

It is based on the V1.1.2 Pascal port PASZLIB 1.0 from Jacques Nomssi
Nzali, see readme.txt for his introduction/documentation.

It includes official patches/changes up to V1.1.4 and some results from
email communication with Marc Adler.

Further changes are in gzio/minigzip, inffixed.inc, minizip, zDeflate
(made code for $ifdef FASTEST usable), zlibh (z_assign as a workaround
for a nasty D6/7/9 bug), ZUtil, example (made test_sync code etc. work).

Other features: 1) zlibex unit with custom deflate and inflate routines
(incl. test program), it is used in the FZCA demo program.  2) Pascal
port of the zpipe sample program. 3) Code improvements: make BUILDFIXED
and assert work, bug fix in gzerror, etc.

Last changes: Delphi 2009 (D12) adjustments

The library can be compiled with BP7 (DOS/Win/DPMI), Delphi 1-7/9/10/12,
Virtual Pascal V2.1 and Free Pascal 1.0/2.0/2.2. (The example programs
minizip and miniunz will not compile under D1, FPC 1.0, or BP7-Win.)

The unit structure is slightly changed compared to paszlib:
ZLIB   (functions),
ZLIBH  (types/consts),
GZIO   (gz functions)
should be the only units USED by applications of zlib.

See manifest for archive layout.

Note: the zlib routines should only be applied to files with sizes less that
2 GB (32 bit counters; Delphi eof bug and/or 32 bit filesize function).
